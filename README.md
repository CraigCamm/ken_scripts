Scripts that I Use --Ken

advanced_callrouting.php - A script I created as a proof of concept for replacing the crazy advanced callrouting logic with a less crazy method.

getopts.php - A php getopts replacement that I used for api cli.

quickgrep - Lets you grep large files keeping track of a seek pointer so you don't have to re-read the top of huge logs when you want to grep.

json_pretty.php - A json beautifier I ported from my bash version to use in php.

json-vim - This beautifies and then opens the pretty json in vim.

redis-clone - (DEFUNCT) A script I used to use to clone phone numbers in redis for testing, doesnt work anymore.

redis-vim - (DEFUNCT) A json editor I created to edit redis data then save the data back to redis, now integrated into api cli.. doesn't work with mongoose data anymore.
